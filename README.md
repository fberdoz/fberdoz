# About Me
Hi, my name is Frédéric Berdoz and you're looking at my GitHub profile. You'll find here all the projects that 
I was involved in (at least all the ones I'm able to share publicly). 
Concerning my skills, I studied Mechanical Engineering and Computational Science & Engineering at EPFL (Switzerland), which explains why these projects are so diverse.

If you want to reach me, you can contact me at frederic.berdoz@alumni.epfl.ch.
