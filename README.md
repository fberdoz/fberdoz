# About Me
Hi, my name is Frédéric Berdoz and you're looking at my GitHub profile. You'll find here all the projects that 
I was involved in (at least all the ones I can share publicly). 
Concerning my skills, I studied Mechanical Engineering (Bachelor) and Computational Science & Engineering (Master) at EPFL (Switzerland), which explains why these projects are so diverse. I also studied for one year at McGill University (Canada) and 6 months at MIT (US). I'm currently a PhD student at ETH Zürich in the Distributed Computing Group supervised by Prof. Roger Wattenhofer. My current topics of interest are AI alignment and AGI.

If you have any questions concerning me or one of my projects, please check my [website](https://fberdoz.github.io).
